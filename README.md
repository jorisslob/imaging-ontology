imaging-ontology
================

The imaging ontology is an ontology that seeks to capture provenance
of microscopy images of various modalities.

The ontology aims to increase the amount of usable metadata that can
be communicated between different research groups, e.g. an image
analysis group gets images from a microscopy lab, but all the
acquisition information is stored in lab books. As more and more
microscopes become digital, automatic metadata generation gets better,
but we see a lot of different formats with almost no integration.

Comparable work 
--------------- 

LOCI Bio-Formats defines a file format that can store a lot of
metadata from microscopy images. It however only deals with light
microscopy.

There are ontologies that (partly) do the same: BAO, BIRNLEX, BRO, EP,
GALEN, NPO, OBI and QIBO. These have to be integrated in some way, we
have to investigate what works best.
